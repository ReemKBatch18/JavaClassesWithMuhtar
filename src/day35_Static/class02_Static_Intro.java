public class class02_Static_Intro {
    // instance : every single object of class has its own copy of instance variables or methods
    // static keyword: is called through the class name. They belong to the class and can always be called through the class name
    /*
    Static means: class member, can be called through class
    Any thing we see that has static belongs ot class and can be called through class name
    instance belongs to object ==> we can create multiple objects from class. Every single object has its own copy
        object only exists if class exist. Object can not exist without class

    All objects sharing class member are sharing one copy ==> we do not have a copy for each object like in instance
    from the class that has static==> all objects sharing same copy
    Those are the 4 members that can be static:
        1.Static variables:
        2. Static methods:
        3. Static initializer block
        4. static nested class
   For example: students in a school are declared as instance variable because each student has his/her own attributes
                But school is declared as static variable because it is the same one for all students

  Local Variables: are variables declared in the block
  Instance variables: are variables declared outside blocks
  Static variables: declared outside any block.
                    must contain STATIC keyword (in lower case)
