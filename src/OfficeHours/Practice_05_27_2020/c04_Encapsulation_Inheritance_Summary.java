ENCAPSULATION:
            * Hiding the data by giving private Access Modifier : CAN NOT BE ACCESSED OUTSIDE CLASS
            * Other sources can only access it through public getter/setter
            * getter (READ_ONLY): returns the private data
            * setter (WRITE_ONLY): assigns argument to the private data
 */

/*
INHERITANCE:
            * builds relationship between super and sub classes
            * IS-A relationship: sub IS-A super
            * sub class: inherits visible variables and methods
            * super class: can NOT inherit from sub class
            * Advantages:
                    * Reusable
                    * Readable
                    * Organized
                    * Easy to memorize (one name for all)
                    * Easy to maintain (you fix in one place if needed)
